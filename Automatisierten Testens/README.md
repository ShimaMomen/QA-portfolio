# OrangeHRM Playwright Automation Framework

This repository contains a **Playwright + TypeScript** automation framework for the [OrangeHRM](https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/) demo application. I am using **Page Object Model (POM)** design patterns, reusable test data, and a clean folder structure.

## Features

- Page Object Model (BasePage, LoginPage, DashboardPage, AdminPage)
- TypeScript + Playwright Test
- Ready-to-use demo credentials
